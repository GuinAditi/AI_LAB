## Additional Test Cases (Simple 3-vertex triangle)

For a simpler test, you can use a triangle graph with 3 vertices:

### Matrix:
```
[0, 1, 1]
[1, 0, 1]
[1, 1, 0]
```

### List:
```
Vertex 0: [1, 2]
Vertex 1: [0, 2]
Vertex 2: [0, 1]
```

This graph has:
- 3 edges
- All vertices have degree 2
- All pairs of vertices are directly connected
- Any sequence of vertices forms a valid path
